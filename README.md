## Setup
Before we get started there are a couple of things we need to do. Start by forking this repository. Once forked be sure to `npm i` or `yarn install` to get the development node_modules (make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the package.json file). The node_modules contains `lite-server` so we can see changes update automatically for us. After you are finished installing, run the following command in your terminal: `npm run lite` (make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the package.json file). You should then see your default browser open up our unfinished template.

#### Summary
Yuck! What an ugly template! Today we are going to go over positioning, flexbox, and the box model so that we can achieve the final design. Having a beautiful UI is just as important as a stable UX. To begin we are going to look at the title section.
